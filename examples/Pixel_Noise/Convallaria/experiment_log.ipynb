    "- **Purpose**: What are you trying to achieve? I want to implement an scheduler that increases sigma in the (p = N(mu, sigma) = N(0,1)) top prior during training. In all the previous experiments my prior was learnable but now I set it to False (so it's not learnable and it is N(0,1)) and then in this case I can increase sigma during training up to some point and then set it back to 1 and do the same again and again and only use PPL (not NPL) in order to learn a well seperated clusters in my latent space.\n",

    "Observation: The alpha values appear to stabilize after an initial phase, converging to a similar range (around 0.16 to 0.18).\n",
    "Interpretation: The stabilization indicates that the relative importance of each class pair in the NPL term has become consistent. The similar values across the alphas suggest that your dynamic computation and normalization of the alpha weights are working effectively, ensuring balanced contributions from each negative pair term.\n",
    "The overall smooth decrease is a good sign of training convergence. The inpainting loss dominates as expected, with the KL and CL losses contributing less significantly due to their smaller weights. The fluctuations in KL loss early in training could be due to the network trying to balance reconstruction with regularization.\n",
